Try to make it look as close to my example as possible. Colors, spacing, etc. - left and right alignment across all elements
Use appropriate HTML 5 semantic containers when possible: header, footer, nav, section, etc...

General
Font used on page should be helvetica 1st choice, arial second choice, sans-serif (backup)

Title in browser tab should be same as main text in header on page (ESTUFF)

Nav and Footer
Nav and footer stay in place at top and bottom.
- These are black with white text and take up full screen width.
- Content in them does not begin all the way on left of screen. Content is centered vertically exactly same as main content.
- The links in the nav must be in a UL.
- The links in the nav are not underlined - except when user puts mouse over link. Then they change to red and get underlined
- Links in header nav bring you to that section of page

Main Content
- Content not full screen - nicely centered (can be fluid, or fixed width (pixels or percentage)). 
- Content not covered by navbar or footer.

Page header
- Colored background, content centered.
- Some space above and below content.
- Contains Title and subtitle.
- Title is UPPERCASE regardless of actual text included in HTML.
- Subtitle has some text in italics
- Rounded corners on bottom.

Products
Products are layed out evenly dividing the available space for the 3 products on screens 800px or larger.
- There are vertical lines BETWEEN the products
- On smaller screens (< 800px) they each take up full width like other content. Horizontal lines go away.
- Each product name is centered.
- Each product has an image or video in it - at least one should be video. Choose the image to be shown for the video before its played.
- Make sure images / video behave (fill up available width but dont overlap one another) even as screensize changes.
- Text below products is justified.

Sign up
- Form is posted (to non existent page) when submitted.
- Both fields are required . Email should be validated.
- Form content is centered.
- Form has colored background with rounded corners on form and on inputs. Inputs have shadows.
- The form is displayed centered inside a colored area with rounded corners.
- On smaller screens (< 1000px) each form part (label + input or button) is on its own line

Financials
- Table
- Doesnt take up full width and is centered.
- When page is made very narrow, table doesnt cause entire page to scroll. Instead table scrolls.
- Text is centered. numbers are right justified. Years are bold (like headers...). Totals are red.
- "Total" at bottom spans 5 columns and is right justified...
- Every other row has a different background.
- When user puts mouse over a row it turns blue.
